# Restaurant Page

A Pizza shop - Restaurant Page

You can test it at: [Restaurant Page: Live Page](https://joaquinarruiz.github.io/restaurant-page/)

-----
#### Process and Some Thoughts:
First approach to the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) technology. I started by installing everything I needed (check webpack.config.js), then I proceed to make an skeleton html of how every page would look like, then I deleted everything and started to build it with js. Finally for the styles I used [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS more precisely) which is a new technology that I hope will stay with me because I loved it. Had some small issues while exporting some functions but figured it out in the end. No big issues while working on this project.

I learned a lot of js, webpack and sass during this project.

-----
#### New Technologies Implemented

- Webpack

-----
#### Known Issues:   
- Need to add more responsive design to the buttons and to the text.
- Need to add animation to the page transition
- No bugs or functional issues known.
